# CHIDVI-556 Memory-Aware Form Agent

The form agent should treat the existing CHIDVI long-term memory system as its source of known user facts rather than creating a second memory database.

## Workflow

1. Open the requested URL.
2. Inspect the visible form and identify fields.
3. Search long-term memory for exact/clear matches.
4. Fill only information that is known with confidence.
5. Narrate meaningful actions.
6. Ask the user when information is missing or ambiguous.
7. Persist useful answers for future form sessions.
8. Resume from the paused field after the user answers.
9. Verify the completed form before reporting success.
10. Request confirmation immediately before high-consequence final submission (payment, legal/government, purchases, job/college applications).

The agent must never invent personal facts or bypass CAPTCHA, OTP, MFA, passwords, or access controls.
